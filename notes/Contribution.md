# Want to add something to the list?

As the main thing here is sharing, everyone is welcome to share with me resources and links to add to the ongoing list. **But** keep in mind that I'll be the end judge and decide if I should add the resources - so mindless tries for free link building would fail if your content is bad.


## Contribution
For contributing the easiest and simple way will be to just add a new Pull request here on Github which I can review later. 

### Requirements
To create a valid PR your resources should be:
- Nested under the specific Topic and Sub-Topic if existing
- Be a valid link
- The link name should contain the website and the original title
- Optional: You can add a couple of words as additional helpful comment or overview
