# What is this and why?

TL: DR - Keep track of notes and resources. Share. Help people on their way to learn.

This is a **personal** list of "curated" articles and resources that I ([simeon-petrov-5](https://github.com/simeon-petrov-5)) find interesting and cool. 99% of the stuff here I have read and/or used as a reference, so I've validated that the resources are pretty helpful. You can find any kind or articles, resources, topics, etc. for Front-end development, as this is my primary subject right now. 

Please consider, that some of the resources here can be outdated now or there can be "something better" - so always, whatever and wherever you find something, consider the information with a "grain of salt" and do a little bit of additional check if it's still (or at all) valid.

As you can see the list is pretty much all around the place and not sorted in any particular order. So, let's call this a ~~bug~~ feature - scrolling around random links you something new and shiny will catch your eye ðŸ˜Ž.
